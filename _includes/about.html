      I'm strongly convinced that machine learning models should not go to waste in Jupyter Notebooks.
      Using my software engineering skills, I've built and deployed AI services which create real business value.

      I enjoy public speaking, writing professional articles, sharing my knowledge and discussing diverse topics.
      Thanks to my training and experience in science communication, I'm able to present complex results to a non-technical audience.
